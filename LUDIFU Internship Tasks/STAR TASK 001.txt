*Star Task 001*

The LUDIFU website is good. It attracts people towards itself . It feels safe working with LUDIFU and it's my personal experience. 

Suggestion :
1. You must add some more workshops along with excel to reach out more people. 
2. There should be some people to guild the interns personally after they have registered. 
3. Website can be made more interesting by adding animations to it. 
      
Overall, the site is good.
