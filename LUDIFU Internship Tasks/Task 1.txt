Experience related to entrepreneurship:
I have the real example of an entrepreneurship its of my brother. Years back he was also going to college as I do but there he saw all the students where running behind the job yes that I could get the job of 50000 per month for 1 lakh per month but he thought to do something out of box he didn't like to work for someone. In fact he thought that why shouldn't I from my own business in which I will work for myself and even my people will work for me instead of me working for others and it really worked firstly he started a small shop which was on a very small amount later he started investing a big amount of money so that it will be getting in touch with the other people too. He started interacting with other peoples and started publishing and marketing is food products and now he has almost a big business. And he earns a lot more than a employee. 
         
I will also build entrepreneurship quality and try  overall development of mine.
