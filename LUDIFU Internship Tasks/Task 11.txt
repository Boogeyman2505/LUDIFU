*Task 11*

Movies before and after special effects

I find it fantastic to see what are the actors actually do it probably takes considerable creativity all the actors part to act against blue and green screen or tho act while strapping in the hamees. 

This video I came to know that the special effects VFX and sfx team are most hard working but they are least appreciated. 

The real award goes to the people who are working back of the stage but the more credit goes to the actors.
