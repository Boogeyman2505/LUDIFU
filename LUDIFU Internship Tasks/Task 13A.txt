*Task 13A*

Finding Your Superpower

“So often the thing people want you to quell, the thing they tell you to be less of, is the thing that you are gifted at.” 

This is such a great way to think about it! The things that people are often threatened by are the things that are our greatest strengths..!!

I absolutely love this...!! We don't help anyone but dimming our light. Also it's okay that we are not for everyone. Our job is to find the people that God meant for us to impact and serve them the best we can. That is NOT to be confused with ignoring a certain group because we choose to remain stagnant and ignorant and refuse to grow.

Our uniqueness is the key to finding our superpower...!!
