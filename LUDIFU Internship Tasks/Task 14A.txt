Learn Outdoor Photography Tips on a Shoot...!!

Photographer Brandon Woelfel teaches us his tips and tricks for taking great photographs as he takes us on a shoot around New York.

Some of his tips are as follows:
1) Hunt for location with depth, or distinct layers of light in the background and foreground.
2) FOr full-body shots, try a long lens like the 85mm or 105mm.
3) Check your white balance with every location or lighting change.
4) Continuous Shutter: Shoot in bursts to capture action.
5) When you change framing, let your model know so they can also change up their pose.
6) For close-ups, switch over to a portait lens like the 35mm or 85mm.
7) Give your model something to interact with, like a prop or piece of scenery.
8) Try to keep your ISO as low as possible, playing with shutter speed to compensate.
9) As the sun sets, smoother poses help keep shutter speed slow.

Through in-depth-lessons on location and in the studio, we will learn how to:
- Dream up creative concepts that take advantage of your surroundings
- Shoot intuitively, chasing light and incorporating props for extraordinary results
- Combine Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop to tease out vibrant colors
- Build your Instagram following by sharing photos and captions that tell a story

Now this is what Iâ€™m looking for. Someone who shares the setting for shutter speed, aperture and ISO for every shot. I enjoyed it alot...!!!
