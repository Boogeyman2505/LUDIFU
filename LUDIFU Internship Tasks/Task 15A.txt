Mark Zuckerberg : How to build a future 

It's a great interview of Mark Zuckerberg, the cofounder of Facebook. In this video , he tells about how he started the work of Facebook. He says he did not had any intension of forming a company before. When he was young he firstly saw the problem that people were facing . He wanted to find such platform that could connect business and people among themselves. In this task, he was not alone. He had his friends with him. Firstly he started the new technology at his school level. Later, the demand was increased and it started spreading. 

Then he started hiring people to expand his business based on their knowledge and love to do something new. 

With lots of efforts and determination finally the Facebook was formed. 

Mark says to do any work will power is important. He himself did not had any experience then too he was able to form such a big company. Anyone can do this. Just the thing is we don't have to be scared and just keep on trying. 
     
Don't start a company for sake of money, start with a problem to solve. Build a company that focuses on learning as fast as possible. 
        
So I learnt that life is the long journey and we must be keen learner through out. I would like to Thank Mark Zuckerberg Sir for inspiring me.
