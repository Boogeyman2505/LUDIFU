How to get startup Idea and test it :: Micheal Seibel

#Start with the problem...?? 
We should first think. .. 
1) Do I have a relationship with this problem personally...?
2) Do I have this problem...?
3) Is it a problem my family has...?

-> Having a personal connection to the problem is helpful.
You can tell whether the solution is in the ballpark of solving the problem.
When you're discouraged, you still have a personal connection to see through until you find a solution that does work.
I understood that Instead of an Idea book have an Problem book. 

# Thinking through problems ::

Talk about it with friends

-> A good thing if you can trade ideas well or build together [potential co-founders]
-> Something you understand that others don't

Look at the people who tried to solve the problem
Look at the products that have been tried

You MVP:
1. Fall in love with the problem and users, not your product.
2. Treat your product in a way that it can change.

This all will make you a very good business man and future is yours.
