How to Answer Behavioral Interview Questions Sample Answers

1. Story Toolbox : Get notable career moment, all written down
 Example : - A time when you saved the day
	   - A time when you worked with a difficult person
	   - A time when you failed
2. Par Method : 
P = Problem (What is the problem or challenge that was put before you..?)
 Example : I had a coworker who I was depending on for reports, but he would constantly tell me that he would not be able to get it to me in time, right when the deadline was about to hit, which impacted my abiltiy to do my job in time.

A = Action (What action did you take to attempt to resolve it..?)  
 Example : I respected him, so i took the concern straight to him to talk it through. I first showed empathy and said, I can imagine you have so much that you are working on right now and i can tell that you are working hard. Then i was direct about how he was affecting me, so i said, and i wanted to discuss the pass three deadlines that we set that you weren't able to meet. When you don't get me the reports on time, it delays the entire production process and leads the rest of us to take serveral hours to readjust the schedule. How can we ensure this doesn't happen in the future?

R = Result (Whta were the outcomes of those action..?)
 Example : I was nervous about the conversation but he opened up to me about how he has always tried to chase down the information for the report and so we came up with a streamlined solution where we now submit a form with every report request and he now he stopped putting off the task and from then on we have been getting the report on time.
