Ok, I will finish what I started when I clicked on this video and "like", comment, and subscribe before going. I make my bed every morning, why? Because I am awake and up for the day, sleep time is over, this is closure--the bed is now closed until bedtime. It's also the start of my day which I finish by slipping into bed at bedtime. I love this video oh so much. It's awesome. You have me thinking about it, simplifying my thoughts around building my Will. Best four minutes of my life.
