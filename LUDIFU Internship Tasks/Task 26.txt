Will Smith's Life Advice

How you can overcome fear, doubt and people not believing in you..??

“Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity. Do not misunderstand me danger is very real but fear is a choice.” - Will Smith

---> The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel who have dreams that want to do things.

---> Talent we had naturally but Skill is only developed by hours of beating on our craft.

---> Will Smith said," He who says he can and he who says he can't are both usually right."

---> Here’s 4 qualities you should work on:

Will Smith has always been one of my idols. This only confirms why.
