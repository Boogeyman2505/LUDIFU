*Task 28*

"The Rock"  Dwayne Johnson's Speech

--> We do today what they won’t, so tomorrow we accomplish what they can’t.

--> If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way. If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.

--> Don’t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams.

--> Let your actions do your talking for you.

--> I’ll never, ever be full. I’ll always be hungry. Obviously, I’m not talking about food. Growing up I had nothing for such a long time. Someone told me a long time ago and I’ve never forgotten it, ‘Once you’ve ever been hungry, really, really hungry, then you’ll never, ever be full.’ So I’ll always be hungry in some way, driven and motivated to get what I want.

--> Success isn’t overnight. It’s when everyday you get a little better than the day before. It all adds up.

--> It ain’t the 99% who’s not putting in the relentless hard work that I care about.  It’s the 1% who is.

--> The men I idolized built their bodies and became somebody – like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger – and I thought, ‘That can be me.’ So I started working out. The funny thing is I didn’t realize back then that I was having a defining moment.

Wow. NEVER heard the Rock speak from the heart like that. Seemed nervous at first but warmed up quickly.
I needed this right now. Feels like everything in my life is going fn sideways. Nothing is the same as it was a couple years ago. Not as confident. I have to fight my way out. I see that now.
