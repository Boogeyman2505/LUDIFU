*Task 4*

In this video, we have seen that, 
How we can sell any product to the customer....??
What skills are required to be the best seller...??

We learnt about 4 P's . 

P - Promise: Every customer does not believe in words  but can trust the promise. 
     
P - Picture: Picture speaks more than anything else. Half of the work is done by the picture as it's more effective. 
       
P-  Proof: Being a seller we must give proofs to customers. 

P - Pitch: A salesperson gets less than two minutes to explain how their business will benefit the prospect. A sales pitch is a well-crafted, then packaged sales presentation. So being a product Seller we must acquire all these qualities and try our level best to convince the customer by telling its quality through the given for P's it will enhance our business much more.

As per my opinion this is the marketing strategy that many of the business owners use to sell the products and expand their businesses and they have reached at the top by using this strategy they make presentations and live demonstrations and give proofs to satisfy the customers need.
