Pros and cons of e-learning
A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as E-learning. 

Advantages of E-learning....!!!

1. Saves time and money - You can manage your schedule and take online courses at your most convenient time. 
       
2. Personalized learning - You can choose your learning path and study at your own pace. 

3. Cost-effective - Students aren’t the only ones that can save money in e-learning. Many educational institutions save money through this set-up because there’s no need to use a physical classroom, which translates to reduced monetary spending.

Disadvantages of E-learning....!!!

1. Lacks social interaction - E-learning is one of the causes of social isolation because you don’t see your teachers and classmates face-to-face. 

2. Inaccessible to others - Power failure aur internet connectivity make it less some time so it may be a very much distraction in your studies and also it is unavoidable. 

3. Cheating is done - Everything is online the students meet sheet for the assessment and for the marks purpose so this is one of the major drawbacks. 


So E-learning is one of the greatest platform to expand your knowledge and broaden the concepts anywhere anytime. 

The real time best example is during the pandemic going on all the students are learning online no going to schools are colleges know teachers in front of you at all just sit at home login and work it's a student's time of travelling saves money. But as there are drawbacks cheating is going on and and laziness takes place of enthusiasm.
