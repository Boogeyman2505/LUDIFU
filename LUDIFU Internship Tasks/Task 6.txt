*What is the Nuclear Family?*
It is the single most important istitution in any society. Without it, our very existence would quickly become jeopardized.

*3 Reasons why the family is fundamental to society*

*Reason 1* : *The Family Provides for Childeren*
Research conducted by health professionals provides ample evidence demonstrating that a married couple is statistically better equipped
when compared to cohabiting couples or single-parent families, to provide a more favourable home for the development f children. 
For example, a medical paper by Wendy D. Manning titled 'Cohabitation and Child Wellbeing' stated the following on Health, Finance, Behaviour.

*Reason 2* : *The Family Benefits a Child's Education*
In these the question arises that - Do childeren in two-parent families do better? And we came to knew about these in BBC article that "Children who were in what the researchers characterised as a 'fragile family', where parents were cohabiting or there was a lone parent, were twice as likely not to graduate from high school...the data showed that even a child in a stable single-parent household was likely to do worse on some measures than a child of a married coupple."
Other paper of American Sociological Review explains that the primary reason for lower educational attainment in these cases is due to single-parent homes suffering from income insecurity.

*Reason 3* : *The Family Provides for the Local Community and the Nation*
Here we came to knew that on both a national and a local community level, governments would do well to support and invest in the nuclear family as statistically, it is the most successful institution in which future generations are developed. The author called William D. Gairdner threw some light on these topic that "In the pure financial sense, the family is the original and still unequalled charitable organization of the world. No State could possibly match it's contribution to the education, health, or moral training of its members; nor could it supply the young of the world with the equivalent in financial assets transferred from generation to generation."

For some reason, the family is being attacked by key elements of society and in doing so our Western nations are unravelling. We need to carefully consider the benefits a family provides and choose, based on scientific observation, statistical analysis and biblical wisdom, the best way forward for humanity.

In my opinion, I've always thought and felt marriage to be a great estate. But that is my personal perspective. By these video i have given sound reasons from the perspective of the benefit of an entire society. So sad to see all the forces at work trying to deprecate if not undermine it entirely.
