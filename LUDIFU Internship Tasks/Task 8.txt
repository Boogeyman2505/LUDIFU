How not to take things personally...!!!!

Frederick Imbo is a football coach. He tells his stories along with a lesson how not to take things personally. 
  
He says that there are many people who try to pull us back by abusing or demotivating. But it's our duty not to take those things personally by the means that it is not meant for me. If you lose people are going to blame you they won't see how hard it is to reach at that position ,they just have interest in the demotivating you .So you have to always be positive in every situation. Yes sometimes happens that you get influenced why such bad conference but you need to overcome those situations and try to move on for the better future. He says that every coin has two sides the one is down and other is about in the same way our life also has two sides the one is happier and the one is sad. It's up to you what you want to be. 

I have personally experienced it lot more time that if if someone ignores me I take it to personally I feel sad, if some of my friends leave me in between I think it's my fault but from now I won't take it personally because if they wanted to stay they will otherwise they will go so it's their choice and not my fault I am happy and will be much happier with whom I have now and no matter how anyone takes me down and always be positive passionate and focused. 
       
I have my Guru Mantra of my life to be happy with what I have and not to take anything personally.
